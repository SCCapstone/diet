SnackTrack is an Android application that connects dietitians and their patients. SnackTrack's primary goal is to assist with 24 hour diet recalls. During these recalls, the patient is required to recite everything he or she has consumed within the past 24 hours. SnackTrack provides a place for patients to take pictures and keep notes of what they eat throughout the day.

There are two types of users in SnackTrack: patients and dietitians. Patients can choose their dietitian, which gives the dietitian access to view the patient's snack entries.

## Installation Instructions

### Option 1: Download and Install the APK File

This is the fastest and easiest way to get the app up and running.

1. **Enable unknown sources in your device's security settings.**
This step is required to install apps outside of the official Google Play Store.
2. **Download the latest APK from our [releases](https://github.com/SCCapstone/diet/releases) to your Android device.**
This can be done in a few different ways. One way is to use the Chrome browser on your device. Simply navigate to our [releases](https://github.com/SCCapstone/diet/releases) and tap the APK file link to download and install it. Another way is to download the file from your computer and manually transfer it to your device's external storage.
3. **Install the APK File.**
If you downloaded the APK file from your device's Chrome browser, you should have been prompted to install the app. If you were not prompted or if you manually transferred the APK file to your device's external storage, use your device's file explorer app (or one of your choice) to navigate to the directory where you placed the APK file. Tap on the APK file and follow the prompts to install the app.
